# Smart-Expense-Tracker-ADO.NET_ML.NET
# 💰 Expense Tracker with ML Predictions (ASP.NET Web Forms + ADO.NET + ML.NET)

## 🧠 Overview
This is a full-featured Expense Tracking System built using **ASP.NET Web Forms (C#)** with **ADO.NET** for database operations and **ML.NET** for machine learning predictions.

The system allows users to manage income, expenses, and budgets — while using AI to forecast spending, detect anomalies, cluster spending patterns, and predict overspending risks.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** ASP.NET Web Forms, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** C#, ADO.NET  
- **Database:** SQL Server (LocalDB)  
- **Machine Learning:** ML.NET (Forecasting, Clustering, Classification)

## 🚀 Features
1. **User Authentication (Login/Register)**
2. **CRUD Operations** for Categories, Income, and Budget  
3. **Expense Forecasting (Time Series Prediction)**
4. **Anomaly Detection (Z-Score Based)**
5. **Spending Pattern Clustering (K-Means)**
6. **Overspending Risk Prediction (Binary Classification)**
7. **Dynamic Dashboard with Smart Tips**
8. **Export to PDF (iTextSharp)**
   

## 📊 ML Models Used
| Model | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|----------|
| Time Series Forecast | Predict future expenses |
| Z-Score Anomaly Detection | Detect unusual spending patterns |
| K-Means Clustering | Group spending categories |
| Averaged Perceptron | Predict overspending risk |


## 🗄️ Database Design
Includes tables:
- **Users**
- **Categories**
- **Income**
- **Budget**

Each table is linked by `UserID` for personalized data tracking.


## 🧩 Why ADO.NET?
ADO.NET gives direct database control with clear SQL queries, which makes CRUD operations simpler to implement and debug for a small-scale project.  
MVC is better for large enterprise apps — but ADO.NET is ideal for learning and direct data handling.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Integration
All ML models are trained dynamically using **ML.NET** each time the page loads or data changes:
- Clustering and classification models are trained in real time.
- Predictions update automatically for each logged-in user.
